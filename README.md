## Description
This is my homework challenge to create the backend for an e-commerce site.

GIVEN a functional Express.js API  
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file  
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize  
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands  
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data  
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application  
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database  
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags  
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia  
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
